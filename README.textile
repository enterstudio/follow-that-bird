h1. Follow that Bird

h2. An implementation for Tweak-the-Tweet style emergency-response syntaxes.

The goal of this project is to search Twitter for tweets matching admin-definable syntaxes, extract defined structure from those tweets, and publish/share that structure as quickly as possible.

The goal is for this project to be a central repository for formatted tweets.  We need to bear in mind extensibility and ease of building plug-in modules in the design and development of this app.

h2. Basic stuff

*Currently:*
* The model layer is somewhat developed.
* Polling twitter search for tweets matching hashtags (script/runner Tweet.poll_indefinitely) exists.
